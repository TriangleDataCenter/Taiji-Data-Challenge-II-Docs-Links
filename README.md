For users unable to access the Taiji Data Challenge II website due to network connectivity issues, the essential documents and links are provided in this repository.

## Highlights 
**Taiji Data Challenge II** (TDC II) comprises 5 groups of datasets (**Challenge 0 - 4**), each targeting specific challenge topics. Except for **Challenge 0** designed as illustrative examples for the access and use of TDC II, most of the remaining datasets are blind (i.e. the source parameters are unknown).

An outline for the challenges:
- **Challenge 0:** the “Verification” Datasets
- **Challenge 1:** the “Global Fit” Dataset
- **Challenge 2:** the “Single Source” Datasets
- **Challenge 3:** the “End-to-End” Dataset
- **Challenge 4:** the “Up-to-Date” Dataset

Each dataset is stored in a separate HDF5 (.h5) file, which can be downloaded at [The Zenodo Page of TDC II](https://zenodo.org/records/15469565) (please make sure to download the latest version). For **Challenge 0 – 2**, a TDI-combined and downsampled version can be downloaded at [The Zenodo Page of TDC II-XYZ](https://zenodo.org/records/15469724).

Detailed descriptions on the challenge topics and datasets, as well as how the datasets are created are described in the TDC II paper and TDC II manual in this repository.
Instructions and examples on how to use these data are provided in the Tutorials of Triangle (the recommended order is Triangle-Simulator -> Triangle-GB / BBH). 
Please make sure to read the README files before use.
