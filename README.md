# Taiji-Data-Challenge-II-Docs-Links
For users unable to access the [Taiji Data Challenge II website](http://gr.imech.ac.cn/overview/) due to network connectivity issues, the essential documents and links are provided in this repository.

## Highlights 
**Taiji Data Challenge II** (TDC II) comprises 5 groups of datasets (**Challenge 0 - 4**), each targeting specific challenge topics. Except for **Challenge 0** designed as illustrative examples for the access and use of TDC II, most of the remaining datasets are blind (i.e. the source parameters are unknown).

An outline for the challenges:
- **Challenge 0:** the “Verification” Datasets
- **Challenge 1:** the “Global Fit” Dataset
- **Challenge 2:** the “Single Source” Datasets
- **Challenge 3:** the “End-to-End” Dataset
- **Challenge 4:** the “Up-to-Date” Dataset

Each dataset is stored in a separate HDF5 (.h5) file, which can be downloaded at [The Zenodo Page of TDC II](https://zenodo.org/records/15469565) (please make sure to download the latest version). For **Challenge 0 – 2**, a TDI-combined and downsampled version can be downloaded at [The Zenodo Page of TDC II-XYZ](https://zenodo.org/records/15469724).

Detailed descriptions on the challenge topics and datasets, as well as how the datasets are created are described in the TDC II paper and TDC II manual in this repository. 
Also provided here is a presentation introducing the aims and design of TDC II. 

Instructions and examples on how to use these data are provided in the Tutorials of Triangle (the recommended order is Triangle-Simulator -> Triangle-GB / BBH). 
Please make sure to read the README files before use. 

## Timelines
Prior to the official release, TDC II will initially deploy a beta test release. During this period, users are encouraged to propose any suggestions regarding the optimization of datasets. Please submit your results by Oct, 9, 2025 at the [Results page](http://gr.imech.ac.cn/results/) (register required*). All the source parameters will be made public after this date. 

- **Beta Test Release:** May, 23, 2025
- **Official Release:** May, 28, 2025
- **Result Submission Due:** Oct, 9, 2025

**NOTE:** Only one account is needed for each team, and individual participants may also register as a single-member team. For users unable to access the result submission website, submitting by email is also supported (Result submissions shall be formatted as plain text (.txt) files containing a header line starting with # specifying the parameter names. Descriptions about the targeted challenge dataset, the methods / algorithms / codes used in analysis, as well as the URL of relevant paper could also be included in the email.)
